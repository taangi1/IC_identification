# Archived Models

This directory contains older, experimental, or unstable machine learning models that are no longer actively used in the software's main production environment.

## Purpose

The models in this folder are kept for historical reference, potential future analysis, or as a record of past experiments. They are generally not recommended for deployment or active use as they may:

* Be outdated or superseded by newer, more performant models.
* Exhibit instability or produce unreliable results.
* Have been part of experimental features that were not fully integrated.
* Be less efficient or optimized than current production models.

## Usage

If you need to access any of these models for research, debugging, or historical comparison, please exercise caution and be aware that their performance and behavior may not be consistent with current expectations.
